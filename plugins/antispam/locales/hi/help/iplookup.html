<h4>आईपी लुकअप फ़िल्टर</h4>
<p>IP Lookup is a filter that checks the IP address of a comment's author on shared lists called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL">DNS-based Blackhole List (DNSBL)</a> (also known as <em>Real-time Blackhole List (RBL)</em>). By default, the filter uses the following servers: <code>sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org</code> and <code>bsb.spamlookup.net</code>. You can find a <a href="http://www.moensted.dk/spam/">list of existing servers on this page.</a></p>

<p>You can add as many servers as you want, separated by commas. Don't forget to click on <strong>Save</strong> to take your modifications into account.<p>
